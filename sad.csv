How likely are you to pick it up for him?","Oral attendance through roll call is being taken. Your friend slept in again and is late. The professor is strict and will not allow him to give his attendance as he is late. The prof will also get angry if they catch you giving a proxy. Would you be willing to take the risk for your friend and give proxy attendance?","Early morning at a long metro ticket line, you see around a dozen people ahead with a senior citizen at the front. He is unable to understand the cashier and pay for his ticket and is clearly in distress. How likely are you to help him with the very high possibility of losing your position in the line that you have got after standing for more than 20 minutes?","You had a very long day and you just submitted a heavy and hectic assignment. You almost fall asleep. But your roommate calls out for some food if possible as he is really sick and cannot handle the hunger pang. But you both have run out of snacks in your room, it's 3 AM so almost everyone is asleep and all canteens on campus are closed. Food delivery apps are offline too now. Though there are some biscuits, something filling to eat is better. How likely are you to get out of your bed and get something from DLF(outside campus, approx 40 minutes to and fro) rather than letting him have those biscuits?","There is an important deadline tonight but some urgent personal issue came up for your friend and he is unable to complete his assignment.

When you go to collect it, the delivery guy is visibly anxious as he has to deliver almost 40 pizzas at once, and would definitely love it if you could help distribute them, as then he could quickly go for other pending deliveries. But doing so would take around 20 minutes, leading to your pizza going cold, and also you will have to take up the responsibility of the proper distribution, failing which you may have to face the wrath of hungry students. Do you think it is worth it to hold off on the pizza and help the delivery man?","Your friend is currently stuck at the airport and missed his flight. He requested you to send him money so he could book another flight, as he is currently unable to get it from his parents. You are reluctant to transfer money, as it is a significant amount and are unsure if he will return it soon. Also your parents won't be happy with this transfer and would get a scolding. Keeping all this mind, how likely are you to transfer the amount?","You notice a dog lying on the roadside, supposedly too weak to cry for help at this point.

Your team has almost qualified for the playoffs with a last deciding match to play. Your passionate friend who has been training rigorously is visibly distressed on not getting a chance to play and requests you to give him some play time. However, you cannot lose the next match and picking him would mean not putting out your best team. How likely are you to take the risk by playing him?","A friend has fallen severely ill and requests you to take him to the hospital, which will engage you the whole day. The main issue is you have a heavy end sem tomorrow which is almost half your course grade. How likely are you to accompany him to the hospital, keeping in mind the option of letting him go alone to the hospital which is bad as he is visibly scared and needs company.","You are preparing for tomorrow’s end sem and rushing to complete topics and papers.
